        <h3>The Player Guides</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Over the years, many players have created guides to help new players understand the different classes of Oberin. Some of us have chosen to hold on to these precious bits of information that our beloved friends have created to continue sharing them with the community not only for the wisdom within but the memories they have left us with. Take some time to view these excellent player based guides and hopefully find some strategies for your own adventures within! Keep note many of these have likely provided some outdated information that no longer applies to the current game mechanics of Oberin, and are meant more as a tribute to the days long past.</p>
