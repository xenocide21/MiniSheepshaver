            <h3>MiniSheepshaver Configuration Tutorials</h3>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>Here I will provide photos and information on how to install and configure Sheepshaver on both Windows and Macintosh. I am not much of a linux guru so you will have to sort that out on your own.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Windows Configuration</h3>
                <p>If you are a Windows user, follow this <a href="tutorial_win.html">link</a> to view the <a href="tutorial_win.html">Windows Tutorial</a>. The recommended system requirements for Sheepshaver is a Dual-Core Processor at 2.0GHz or better, 2048MB RAM (4096MB for Windows 7+) and Windows XP to Windows 10. The process is similar for Mac OS X 10.7 to macOS 10.14, however there are some key differences to installing Sheepshaver on macOS, thus there will be a separate tutorial for Mac users provided.</p>
                <h3>macOS Configuration</h3>
                <p>For macOS users I will be providing a special build that I will need to set up on my native MBP. As of this time the process to set up Sheepshaver does not work in the current distribution of MiniSheepshaver v6.0. As most people are running Windows based machines, I have not spent a lot of time fixing the configuration for Sheepshaver on macOS, though this is a poor excuse. I will do my best to ensure that macOS users have a better experience going forward. Please stay tuned for the macOS build of MiniSheepshaver v6.0.</p>
