                <h3>MiniSheepshaver Builds</h3>
                <br>
                <ul class="dl">
                    <li>
                        <a href="data/MiniSheepshaver-v6.0-B46.2.zip" download>MiniSheepshaver v6.0</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="data/MiniSheepshaver-v6.0-B46.2-Image-Only.zip" download>MiniSheepshaver v6.0 Image Only</a>
                        <p>This is the lightest build of MiniSheepshaver, only bare essentials here, and a couple of useful programs you might need to enhance your oberin experience. If you already have Sheepshaver set up, you can download the image only, add it to your Sheepshaver directory, and set your config to boot from the new image file.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="placeholder" download>MiniSheepshaverUltra v1.0</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="placeholder" download>MiniSheepshaverUltra v1.0 Image Only</a>
                        <p>This build of MiniSheepshaver is quite a bit larger in size than MiniSheepshaver v6.0 however it is jam packed with a bunch of utilities, larger disk image for additional storage space, and can do much more than the minimalist MiniSheepshaver v6.0. Please take note only MiniSheepshaverUltra has a built in web browser. To maintain minimalist size for v6.0 a web browser has been omitted from the build.</p>

                <h3>Oberin Client Updates</h3>
                <h5 style="margin-left: 2px">Build Version 46.2</h5>

                        <a href="data/OberinClient.sit" download>Oberin Client.sit</a>
                        <p>This is the client download for Mac OS 9. This link will be updated as new builds are released.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="data/OberinClient.zip" download>Oberin Client.zip</a>
                        <p>This is the client download for Mac OS X. I am providing it here as well since even OS X has troubles with modern browsing.</p>

                <h3>Additional Utilities</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="data/GTK+-2.10.13_Windows.7z">GTK+ 2.10.13 Windows Binary</a>
                        <p>GTK+ is a required package to run Sheepshaver on Windows, if you are not sure, or dont have it make sure you download and install this software.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="data/7z1900.exe">7z File Compression Utility Windows (32bit)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="data/7z1900-x64.exe">7z File Compression Utility Windows (64bit)</a>
                        <p>7z is a popular file compression and decompression utility for Windows. The .7z format tends to be smaller than a standard .zip file. You may find some files uploaded here using the .7z format. 7z File Manager can decompress a wide variety of compression formats, so it can still be useful to you for .rar, .zip, .bin and many other file formats.</p>
