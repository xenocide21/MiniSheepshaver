                <p>There are still some websites capable of loading on Mac OS 9!!! Unbelievable right? Well here are a few websites you can visit in Classilla on your Mac OS 9 system, and any OS X web browser!</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Mac OS 9 compatible websites</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://macintoshrepository.org">Macintosh Repository</a>
                        <p>Macintosh Repository is a archive for Macintosh software, it has a massive database of software downloads for almost any task. The website has a lot of detailed information provided for each application such as description, compatibility, and often accompanied by photos of the disk, and/or application running on mac os. The site is free to sign up and download many files, and encourages users to upload any software they do not currently have, including different versions! The advanced search feature makes it easy to find software and this website is designed with old web browsers in mind, and as such is very quick to navigate on.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org">Macintosh Garden</a>
                        <p>While Macintosh Garden does render on Mac OS 9, it does have some graphical errors and is somewhat slower than Macintosh Repository, however it is worth mentioning. Macintosh Garden is another massive archive of classic mac software. If its not on Macintosh Repository or Macintosh Garden, it might not exist!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.google.com">Google!</a>
                        <p>Thats right! The infamous Google still works! I wouldn't expect many of the websites you attempt to visit from a search will work however. Feel free to see what you can do with google on Classilla, or OS X Web browsers.</p>
                    </li>

                        <a href="http://macos9lives.com">Mac OS 9 Lives</a>
                        <p>In truth.. it does in a way. There is still many users continuing to develop and use Mac OS 9 for specific tasks. Often these tasks are only capable of being done on Mac OS 9, otherwise why did I build this emulator anyway?! Mac OS 9 Lives is a community forum and information hub for Mac OS 9 enthusiasts world-wide. Feel free to stop in and check them out! The site performs well on Classilla 9.3.3.</p>
