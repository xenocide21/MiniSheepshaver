            <h3>What is MiniSheepshaver?</h3>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>MiniSheepshaver is a specialized build of Sheepshaver for Oberin players around the world. It is a very slimmed down system installation with only the extensions and basic utilities needed to run Oberin.</p>

                <h3>The run down.</h3>
                <p>I first played Oberin on a classic macintosh, more than 10 years ago, and I like many of my friends in the Oberin community, have stuck with it through all the years and we do whatever it takes in many cases to continue playing this game. Seeing that a lot of people had a hard time getting Sheepshaver working, I have spent the last year and some months building easily configurable packages for the community to continue playing this great game. I enjoy being able to provide this service for our community and decided it's time to build this website for the dedicated players of Oberin to make updating and enhancing the experience more user friendly while using MiniSheepshaver.</p>
